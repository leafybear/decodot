Amy's lemonbar setup based on:
tb01110100's experimental bar setup

## START
Make a link from the bar you prefer to
"bar". Minimal or Full

## SETTINGS
Change you fonts and color theme in the
settings file.

Can also change what icon/symbol/text
precedes your data blocks in the bar.

## COLOR THEMES
Change the color theme in your settings file 
to one from the themes/ folder

## FONTS & SYMBOLS
Copy the fontello font to $HOME/.fonts
and run fc-cache -fv
to update the font cache.

Then use these letters for symbols
in your bar:

! audio
" watch
# disk
$ computer
) fire
( music
+ beaker
& calendar
