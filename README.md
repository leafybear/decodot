# README.md

v1 2017.11.18
Created Readme and first version of dots repo. It works with STOW for now, but I'm planning something better. You'll see.

## What's Included
Configuration files for:

* shells
    - bash
    - zsh
* x
    - xresources
    - urxvt
    - i3wm
    - bspwm
    - sxhkd
    - compton
    - polybar
    - lemonbar
    - conky
    - mpv
* cli apps
    - irssi
    - ranger
    - ncmpcpp
    - mpd
    - tmux
    - vim

You can use one, some, or all of these config files.

## Who it's for
I aim to make it easy to use this folder as a command-line bootstrap. So, its for cli fiends and beginners alike. Linux and mac are the most compatible at the moment.

## How to use
For now, use STOW to make symlink to the folder. More on this coming soon.
