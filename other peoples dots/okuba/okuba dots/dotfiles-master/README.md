# Dotfiles

dotfiles for my i3 + lemonbar setup on ArchLinux

I use this configuration for my laptop which runs **[i3-gaps window manager](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)** (a fork of i3) on
**[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)**.
Ideas mostly <del>stolen</del> copied from others and modified to fit my use, I have acknowledged some but if I'm using parts or all of your config, **THANKS!**.

## Dependencies
*Note: I hope I've covered all dependencies here, but something might be missing*

This setup is intended for **[i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)** by Airblader. I haven't tested it with regular i3-- you'll probably have to make a few changes if you want to use that. Only tested on ArchLinux-- I can't make any guarantees about its compatibility with other distros.

## Housekeeping
1. First, install the dependencies listed in the section above.

2. `bin/` contains custom scripts. Add them to your `$PATH` and ensure that they are executable.

3. My default shell is zsh and I use the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) framework to manage my zsh configuration.

4. You need to have [gnupg](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/gnupg/) installed and configured properly for [pass](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/pass/) to work.

5. Xresources colors are generated using [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)

6. Using [xero's hashwall script](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/bin/hashwall) to generate and set wallpaper
